## How to Load

Any coding agent that reads markdown skill files can load PaperPilot:

1. Clone this repository
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` (agent behavior rules) or `skills/paper-agent/SKILL.md` (meta-skill protocol)
3. The agent becomes a PaperPilot-powered research assistant

## CLI Protocol

```bash
pp doctor --json           # Environment capabilities
pp inspect <dir> --json    # Project state (7 dimensions)
pp workflow plan <skill>   # Plan execution
pp workflow commit <skill> # Commit results
pp workflow verify <skill> # Mark as verified
pp workflow recover        # Restore from last revision
```

## Evidence Status Contract

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| planned | Scheduled but not executed |
| user_supplied | Researcher provided (not machine-verified) |
| executed | Code produced this result |
| verified | Passed validation checks |

## Agent Guide Interface

Every skill returns after completion:

```json
{
  "completed": "<skill-name>",
  "artifacts": ["<relative-paths>"],
  "context_written": ["<context-keys>"],
  "next_steps": [{"skill": "...", "reason": "...", "ready": true/false}],
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

The meta-skill (paper-agent) uses this to recommend the next action.
